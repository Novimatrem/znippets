and as I stepped into the unknown, I get the sudden realization that everything is strangely familiar, as though I've been carrying this feeling in every moment and every place I've inhabited and existed, and more to the point after many occasions been made to feel awful by the continuation by chemical anomalies.
Because everything around me is a viral indication of an internalized ideal of what I believe to be reality, but it's also completely and unbelievably unique in every sense of the word, and that I am as much in control of this construct as I am in control of how you feel hearing these words.
and all the time I got confused, angry, and insatiably discontent, with the reaction of punishing the certain events of creation, and they are in conclusion, the same thing in a computer reality, created only since we care too much about the petty construction that was built up around our existence.
Surrounded by a placeholder, until we've been manipulated into believing, a single electron moving in all directions and all times as we watch from our vantage point at the edge of the explosion.
