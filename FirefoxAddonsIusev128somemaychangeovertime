~ Firefox Addons I use v128 (may change/improve over time) ~

All gotten from https://addons.mozilla.org/ - of course. I don't recommend getting addons from elsewhere.

A lot of these addons are related to protecting user privacy, and making the web less cancerous.

I recommend configuring both Firefox itself, and every addon you have, fully and entirely, to ensure you have full control and settings that you want. Including privacy-respecting about:config tweaks that you can search for. (privacytools.io)

I value Mozilla and what they do for keeping the web open, private and safe, and wish them and Firefox itself great success and luck in the future.

Firefox Addons I use;
Search for them on the Mozilla Addons site for more information/screenshots, do your own research- it's wise to not just install Addons on my (a single person's) word alone.

THEME;
The default "System theme - auto" theme, 
because it tends to integrate with the system's theme very well.
