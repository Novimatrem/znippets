# Set Trackpad cursor speed

# I heavily recommend disabling mouse acceleration, first, before also doing this, for more consistent, accurate, raw mouse movements;

# See current Trackpad speed value
synclient | grep MaxSpeed
synclient | grep MinSpeed
synclient | grep AccelFactor

# Set Trackpad speed value
synclient MaxSpeed=1
synclient MinSpeed=1
synclient AccelFactor=0

# depending on various factors, this may not have any effect on your hardware. YMMV.
