# Experiment to improve bad touchpad/trackpad behaviour on my main laptop (SEE EDIT)

# DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO YOUR INSTALL IF YOU FOLLOW THIS.

sudo apt remove -y xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg-input-libinput
sudo reboot now # reboot the system

# hope it works, ðŸ¤ž

# EDIT: doing this seems to enable "disable mouse movement while typing", I can't deal with that.
#           to undo this, re-install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics and reboot.
