tf2 maps that need optimization and i cannot play them reasonably on my current slow CPU v1
tldr; The TF2 maps Mountain Lab, Pier, Mercenary Park, and Mossrock are quite unoptimized and run real badly. I'd avoid those ones.
Do not queue into these maps with friends, and un-tick them from your own saved queue-list.
