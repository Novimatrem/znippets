# copy this text into a new ztp.cfg file in cfg folder of game, open console and type: exec ztp

# don't type the command again if you are already successfully in third-person, or it can cause issues.

# if typing exec ztp doesn't work, it's fine, most of the script has worked, just go console and
# type thirdpersonshoulder (and if that doesn't work, type thirdpersonshoulder AGAIN for a second time)
