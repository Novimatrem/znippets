# Launch Steam w/o steamwebhelper to save 6% extra RAM on average

Append the following to the Target/command of your Steam shortcut, and then hit OK/save;

-no-browser +open steam://open/minigameslist

To undo this, close Steam, and put your shortcut back how it was.
Steam will only launch without webhelper if you launch it via this shortcut you created.
