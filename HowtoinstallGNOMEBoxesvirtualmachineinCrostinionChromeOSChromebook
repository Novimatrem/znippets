# How to install GNOME Boxes virtual machine in Crostini on Chrome OS (Chromebook)

# Not a script, follow this manually, yourself.

# Enter the following three commands:
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virtinst libvirt-daemon nano
sudo apt install -y gedit
sudo apt install -y gnome-boxes

# Then we're going to edit a config file to be as we'd wish
cd /etc/libvirt
sudo chown $USER qemu.conf 
gedit qemu.conf

# Scroll down to around lines 519 to 523, and look for the line that says:
# "Since a sequence of digits is a valid user name"
# once you're there, you should see two commented out lines that look like:
# #user = "root"
# and then, slightly below that,
# #group = "root"
#...you will want to UNCOMMENT these lines, so they are set, (remove #) and save the file.

# So, those lines should look like:
user = "root"
# and then, the one nearby under it,
group = "root"

# and then you're to save it.

# Now type simply:
cd
# (on its own) to return to the home folder. Just cd

# Once you're there,
# To allow the virtual machine to work, you need to type the following command:
xhost +

# You should see a line that says:
# access control disabled, clients can connect from any host

# Now you're ready to launch and use GNOME Boxes, type:
sudo gnome-boxes

# It should now launch and be fully usable.
# BUT, do not use it yet.
# Close GNOME Boxes and the Terminal, and any other open tasks, and
# SHUT DOWN AND RE-START YOUR CHROMEBOOK.

# After that, to launch GNOME Boxes, 
# an icon to start it is in the Start Menu, either directly, as Boxes,
# or it may be inside of the Linux Apps folder,
# you can pin it to the shelf, too.
# Enjoy!

# (actually teaching you how to *USE* GNOME Boxes is outside of the scope of this guide)
# (look elsewhere for tutorials on the actual usage of the program itself)
