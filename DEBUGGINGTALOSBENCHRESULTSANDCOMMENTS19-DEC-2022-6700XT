DEBUGGING: TALOS BENCH RESULTS AND COMMENTS 19/DEC/2022 - [6700 XT]

Talos Benchmark 60 secs (with my new 6700 XT)



OpenGL, Linux Native: 77.8fps
OpenGL, Proton: 69.0fps

Vulkan, Linux Native: 114.0fps
Vulkan, Proton: 114.2fps

DirectX9, Proton: 118.2fps
DirectX11, Proton: 118.9fps
DirectX12, Proton: 102.7fps



I need to do further testing in a different game of my OpenGL performance, specifically. :(
Hope everything is fine with my OpenGL performance in general....!!
(I HAVE HEARD that the update that added Vulkan greatly improved Linux performance in Talos, so
    it may just be specific to this game that the OpenGL perf isn't anywhere near as equal.)
