-- misskey inspired cat-mode toot text manipulation lua script (catmode.lua)
-- thank you to binarycat for making this for me and explaining how it works

-- simply run the script, type your post, and press enter, then your clipboard will
--  have the nyaified version ready to paste

s = string.gsub(io.read("l"), "na", "nya")
io.popen("xclip -i -selection clipboard", "w"):write(s)

-- to run, use `lua catmode.lua` (no quotes), you can even alias it in your bashrc for easy access
