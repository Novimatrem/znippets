# the full and exhaustive guide on how to properly set/change hostname linux v2

# this is why they say to never try to change your hostname, 
#   don't do this unless you really need to.


# so, think of a new hostname, and remember it.


# use this command, replacing the REPLACEME with the hostname you wish;
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname REPLACEME

# then type THE SAME THING, AS THE HOSTNAME, replacing the old one in this file with it,
sudo nano /etc/hosts


# then, *THIS* file should contain nothing but your hostname text on a single line, make it the same.
sudo touch /etc/hostname
sudo nano /etc/hostname


# then, use the hostname command with the same name once again.
sudo hostname REPLACEME

# then use nmcli to set it, also, using the same name as before.
sudo nmcli general hostname REPLACEME

# then use sysctl to set it, same name.
sudo sysctl kernel.hostname=REPLACEME

# then these three commands, with the same name also.
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --pretty REPLACEME
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --transient REPLACEME
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --static REPLACEME

# and do this one too
sudo su
echo "HOSTNAME=REPLACEME" >> /etc/sysconfig/network

# reload a systemd bit to make sure it sticks
sudo systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed

# and so selinux doesn't complain,
sudo su
sudo touch /.autorelabel

# finally, you must reboot your system to reflect your changes.
sudo reboot now
