# How to fix misaligned mouse cursor on second screen in Windows

If your mouse is accurately clicking where it shows on your first screen, but not on your second, this will help.
It sounds very odd, but, it truly does.

Go into the Mouse Properties screen, otherwise known as "Change Mouse Settings".
Go into the Pointer Options tab, and under 'Visibility' enable "Display Pointer Trails", and then set the Length to the lowest amount.
This turns your mouse into using Software-rendered mouse mode, which means it fixes the problem, and will now be accurate.

Weird, huh? But, it works, so now I can use my second monitor properly.
Hope this helped!

NOTE: This option can frequently randomly disable itself again, because Microsoft. If you have the issue again, check the setting's on!!
