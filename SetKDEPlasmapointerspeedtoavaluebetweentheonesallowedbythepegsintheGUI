# Set KDE Plasma pointer speed to a value *between* the ones allowed by the pegs in the GUI

You can modify the value of the mouse pointer speed in KDE to allow values between what the pegs
 allow you to set in the GUI by going to your home directory, navigate to .config folder and then
  open `kcminputrc` file. ( /home/<your_username>/.config/kcminputrc )

You should see a line that says something like this:

`XLbInptPointerAcceleration=`

Just change the decimal value to suit your needs. Once you saved, just reboot/reset your KWin/Plasma
 desktop.

Personally for me, it seems those two pegs in the settings set it between 0.6, to 0.8, so my perfect
 sensitivity would be 0.7


Thank you so much to The Linux Legend (@LinuxLegend@fosstodon.org) for figuring this out for me,
