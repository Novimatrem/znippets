# Back up .minecraft to OneDrive automatically (Windows)

# Open cmd as admin, run

mkdir C:\Users\TheNo\OneDrive\MinecraftDot\

mklink /J C:\Users\TheNo\OneDrive\MinecraftDot\.minecraft C:\users\TheNo\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

# As long as OneDrive is running and working, you're all good.

# Obviously change the paths before running the commands, because your username will differ.
