actual reasonable software sources for the modern chromebook v2:


Chromebook specific/optimized Android apps - (from the Google Play Store), 
acquired from these 3 sources;

https://play.google.com/store/apps?device=chromebook

https://play.google.com/store/games?device=chromebook

<the play store app on chromeos chromebooks>


anything else is not worth using.
(despite how promising they may sound)
