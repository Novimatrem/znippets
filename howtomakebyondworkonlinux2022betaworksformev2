[wine+playonlinux experience required to follow this guide atm, i may
 make this into a more friendly blog post down the line, rather than just
  a snippet, we'll see]

from my research, wine 3.8 32bit (x86) seems to work best.
use this version specifically in playonlinux. ( tools > manage wine versions )

[do these in a 32-bit prefix only]
[it only actually works in a 32-bit prefix only]

make a 32-bit wineprefix

enter a shell inside of it

winetricks wsh56 wsh57 jscript vcrun2013 mfc42
winetricks ie8
winetricks vcrun6
winetricks riched30 wsh57 vcrun2013 ie8 gdiplus_winxp ogg ole32

winetricks ie8_kb2936068
[after running the previous line, after you have clicked through the IE8 update installer,
 and after it has CLEARLY FINISHED, open system monitor and kill the process IE8-WindowsXP-KB2936068-x86-ENU.exe 
  and then continue]

winetricks mfc42 gdiplus vcrun2008 vcrun2013 wsh57 ogg ole32 riched30 msls31 ie8

[fully close out of wine everything and playonlinux after these have installed, and then open playonlinux again]

install byond with its installer, now, running its installer exe in wine.
DO NOT RUN THE GAME WHEN OFFERED AT THE END OF THE INSTALLER.

go to
~/.byond_client/drive_c/Program Files/BYOND/directx
and install directx by running the exe in Wine.

you can now run the game, it should work fine!
to use the app, you require a system tray/notification area to pop it up. GNOME lacks this by default.

make a shortcut to byond.exe, and have fun~


OPTIONAL, UNTESTED: maybe also run this in a shell for fonts: 
winetricks corefonts
winetricks tahoma
