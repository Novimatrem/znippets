# isaac-resize.sh v2

# My main system (Arch Linux, Xfce4, AMD GPU) lags sometimes, playing Flash Isaac.
# Let's reduce its resolution to as low as possible.

# Script is designed to target "Santa's Big Adventure" (Linux version) on Steam, with the Isaac SWF from
# the Humble Store loaded into it with Ctrl+F and then Ctrl+O. If you're using any other Isaac Flash, you will
# need to change the name of the Window Title it is looking for in the script below.
