Open the console (~) and enter this command, and after that, restart your game.
If it's being set by your config file, then perhaps you'll have to type this every time.

/seta com_hunkmegs 256

Or, you may have to append this to your game's shortcut with something like this instead;
+seta com_hunkmegs 256 +com_hunkmegs 256
