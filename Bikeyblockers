# Bikey blockers

My bike is locked in the shed which I do not have access to.
My bike is in need of a thorough checking-over and slight repair, as far as I remember.
I'd prefer if I was going bikey *with someone*, but this never happens.
I have to get myself all prettied up for going outside.
I'd have to bike fully masked-up due to wishing to stay thoroughly safe against covid.
I struggle to climb onto the bike itself, it's a little tall, I will have to learn the method.

My sleep routine is ALWAYS a mess, which means asking for access to the shed to get the bike, & also
    going bikey *with someone*, are both impossible most of the time..

Think that's all the blockers.
