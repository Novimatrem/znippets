// afterload_tf2compfix.cfg v3
//
// TF2 Competitive (Valve's version) has a bug, for me, where motion blur and specular shiny is -
//      - RE-ENABLED after I load into Valve's Competitive, I do not want these on, and as such -
//          - I bind this script to a key, and press it when I have loaded into it, to fix it.

// Motion blur, and shiny distracting reflective materials, have no place in a competitive game

// You will need to put the following line into your main autoexec, which I must remind you,
// in TF2 is called custom.cfg in most situations, instead of what you'd expect.
bind "p" "exec afterload_tf2compfix.cfg"

// The following lines will fix the issue
