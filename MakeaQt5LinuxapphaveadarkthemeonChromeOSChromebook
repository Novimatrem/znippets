# Make a Qt5 Linux app have a dark theme on ChromeOS (Chromebook)

In the Linux Terminal, type: 
sudo apt install -y qt5ct

Launch it from the Linux Terminal with the command: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct qt5ct

Under Palette, select Custom, and set the colour scheme dropdown: darker

Press Apply, and then Press OK

Then type the following commands, in order:
touch /home/$(whoami)/.profile
echo 'QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"' >> /home/$(whoami)/.profile
echo 'export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"' >> /home/$(whoami)/.profile

sudo chown $USER /etc/environment
sudo touch /etc/environment
sudo chown $USER /etc/environment
sudo su
sudo echo 'QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"' >> /etc/environment
sudo echo 'export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"' >> /etc/environment

touch /home/$(whoami)/.bashrc
echo 'QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"' >> /home/$(whoami)/.bashrc
echo 'export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"' >> /home/$(whoami)/.bashrc

Type this command, and scroll down to the 5th line:
nano ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf
Change where it says style=Fusion into saying style=darker
then press Ctrl+X, Y, and then Enter, to save and quit the nano text editor.

Shut down and restart your Chromebook.

To launch a Qt5 app with a dark theme, use the following command:

QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct application-name

For example:

QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct plasma-discover
