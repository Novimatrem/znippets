The pillars of a DE/WM being any good [for me] (revision 4)

If a desktop environment/window manager doesn't do the following, I can't stand it, and thus do not expect me to use it.

(note that my criteria for what makes a desktop usable may change over time)

1. Has the ability to search through all installed applications for a specific one, and have this be very quick to access.
(For example, pressing the Super key in most distros will allow searching for applications immediately, or Ctrl+Escape on Xfce).

2. Has the ability to list all installed applications in a visible and readable form.
(For example, GNOME 3's "applications menu" [Super+A], and Xfce4's xfce4-appfinder.)

3. Has the ability to set applications as favourites, to be accessed in an easy accessible way.
(For example, Cinnamon's 'Pin to Panel', Xfce4's favourites in the start menu, Pinning to the Ubuntu Dock, etc.)

4. Has the ability to track notifications into a list for referring to at a later time. So I don't miss anything.
(For example, the Notifications log that can be enabled in current Xfce, the Recent Notifications applet indicator for Unity 7, etc.)

5. Has the ability to fully use all types of things known as "tray icons", "appindicators", etc.
I find these things, that go by various names, very important- some applications I use REQUIRE them--
and even if they're not strictly REQUIRED, they're really nice to have. 
GNOME 3 broke their support recently, but there are extensions to hack-back full functionality.

6. Has the ability to set a 'default monitor' for things such as fullscreen game opening, "taskbar", etc.
If this isn't possible, stuff opens on the wrong monitors, and it is really annoying. It's even worse in-
  -desktops where you can't move fullscreen programs and games *between* monitors.

If a desktop has those functions, I can start to get along with it, even if it's not perfect. If not, it's not AT ALL for me.
