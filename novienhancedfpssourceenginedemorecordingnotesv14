// novi enhanced fps source engine demo recording notes v14

// and by enhanced fps i only mean 48fps (at 720p) because this shit's demanding, yo

// so, it's essentially perfect, but with 2 flaws that i cannot fix:
//
// 1. the only encoder you can use on linux for demos is low-quality, as such, you should just
//  record the demo's playback with OBS instead, in 720p60.
//
// 2. there's a bug where the screen flickers when you jump, this is fixed in a really annoying way,
//  you see, if you set cl_interp to 0, it fixes the bug and you can jump freely, but, it then breaks
//   the animation framerate of any NPC.., nothing i can do. best you can manage is as such:
//    during normal gameplay use cl_interp 0, so that you can jump and move freely, and then, just
//     before a cutscene stop the demo, quicksave, disconnect, set cl_interp to 0.1 and then load
//      the save and start your demo again, now with smooth NPC animations, but you CAN NOT JUMP, or
//       it will look flickery and glitchy. when you get out of the cutscene, stop demo, save game,
//        disconnect, set cl_interp back to 0, and then load the save and start demo again. yeah...

// prepare
cl_interp 0
// if you want to smoothly record NPC's, you need cl_interp to 0.1 instead, but that breaks JUMPING..

// ENSURE THAT YOU close the game after processing your demo, to properly close the file.

// IF YOU MUST RECORD THE DEMO USING OBS (some games export is broken) MAKE SURE IT'S SET 720p60fps

// ensure your demo recording file does not go over 2GB, or it will corrupt.

// demos and output can be found in the game's internal folder, on the same level as
// cfg and gameinfo.txt, as novidemo52.dem and then novidemo52.webm after processing
