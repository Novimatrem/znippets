# figuring out functions in python, and how they
# have parameters and can return things

def doubler(num):
    num = num * 2
    return num

num = doubler(420)

print(num)


num = doubler(20)

print(num)

# and now instead of just doubling the one defined num when i run the function,
# like in the previous script, i can now double any num i want at any time
# uwu

# you can use it with writing
# doubler(22)
# 44
#
# or assign its result to a variable with something like
# num = doubler(10)
# print(num)
# 20
