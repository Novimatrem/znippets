// This *used* to make use of torkel104's GitLab version of libstrangle,
// this, specifically: https://gitlab.com/torkel104/libstrangle 
// but that started not working for me, after a long time,
// and had started causing games to not launch, sadly.
// Previous versions of this launch option had the following included, 
// but it was crashing, keeping it here just in case; STRANGLE_VSYNC=0 strangle 57 %command%
