Crostini notes (Chromebook):

I didn't have a great first experience getting my Chromebook as Linuxy as I could.
I had no success with GalliumOS, Chrx, or Crouton, they all failed, some dramatically!

I was left with the final option I could try being Crostini, Google's Linux Debian sandboxy containerized thing.

Apparently you can just install the KDE desktop & gnome-software store seamlessly.
This is what encouraged me to try.

Ensure you are fully updated in the Settings > About ChromeOS page.
Perhaps even opt into the beta, from there.

Press the Search key/click the start menu button, and type Linux, hit Enter.

Turn on the Linux development environment option in the settings, there.

Enter exactly 50% *of the space remaining free/available on your disk* when it asks.
(for me this was 22GB, because I had 44GB free)

When the initial terminal pops up after it's installed, type the following commands:

sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y

(^ to ensure you'll be fully up to date ^)

Then, type these following commands to get you all you'll need initially, to get going:

# Installs
sudo apt install -y task-kde-desktop
sudo apt install -y dolphin
sudo apt install -y papirus-icon-theme
sudo apt install -y gimp
sudo apt install -y gnome-software
sudo apt install -y gnome-software-common
sudo apt install -y plasma-discover
sudo apt install -y plasma-discover-common
sudo apt install -y gedit
sudo apt install -y pip
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y synaptic
sudo apt install -y command-not-found

After all that, type this command again to ensure all is up to date and fine;

sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y


Then you should be all good to go, good luck, and have fun! Hope it helps!
