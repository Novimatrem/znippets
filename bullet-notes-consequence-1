Quick bullet notes regarding Consequence 1
bullet-notes-consequence-1.txt
==============================================

Become permanently mute.

Don’t speak.

Stop putting yourself in situations that'd incentivise speaking, such as by not sitting with or around others.

Just become a silent person, naturally.

If you're ever forced to speak, and can't think of any alternatives, do so as quietly as you can get away with, and for as short as possible.

Simply be more expressive in your body language as an alternative.

If you're ever forced to stay around others, or in other situations that'd incentivise speaking, stand in corners, away from others, make yourself look small, so that you're not picked-up upon as readily to be made do so.

Wear big headphones, to make it obvious you’re not to be talked to. They don’t have to be playing music or audio. Also wear hoodies with the hood up.

Be a listener, a very good listener.

Wear a mask more often, not only is that good for not getting covid, but it will give you a good excuse to not bother. Would be a bit awkward in the house though.

Just simply never talk again.
