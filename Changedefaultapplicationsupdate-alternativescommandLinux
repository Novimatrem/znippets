# Sometimes, the GUI doesn't allow you to change the defaults for all you'd wish
# this command will allow you to change all the defaults you wish, easily.

sudo update-alternatives --all


# (if you'd just wish to change the default text editor, this will probably suffice);
sudo update-alternatives --config editor


# GNOME 3 advice;
# If a file will NOT open with the right editor by default;
# If your app opens normally with an editor you don't wish
# if using the Right click > Open with other application doesn't let you set the default, then use
# Right click > Properties, go to the third 'Open With' Tab, and set the default application in there.
