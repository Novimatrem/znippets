The only good My Little Pony (MLP), imo.
Specifically;



My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (AKA Generation 4)
From Season 1 ep01, to Season 4 ep26.

My Little Pony: Equestria Girls (film) [mid-2013]

My Little Pony: Equestria Girls â€“ Rainbow Rocks [late-2014]



Nothing after that/later than that.


(and of course fan stuff created in those times/created about those episodes/in that era.)


At worst, anything somewhat after November 2014, and beyond, is generally a no-go.
