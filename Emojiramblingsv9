# how to type them
While in a text field, right-click and select the "Insert Emoji" option from the context menu.

# possible key combos to type them if the 'Insert Emoji' option is missing
If that doesn't work, try hitting Ctrl + . (full stop).

If that doesn't work, try hitting Control + Shift + E, then press 'Space', works in most apps.

If that doesn't work, try hitting Ctrl + ; (semi-colon)

If that doesn't work, try hitting Alt + M

If that doesn't work, try hitting Super + E

If that doesn't work try typing the emoji name between colons :heart:

If that doesn't work, try looking for an emoji button you can click with your mouse, silly


# backup way to type them if all else fails
sudo apt install -y gnome-characters

open gnome-characters "sometimes just named characters", find an emoji, and click it to copy it.
