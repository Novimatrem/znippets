# how to disable selinux and thus make selinux shut the fuck up forever v3

# i've been told this is a bad idea to do, and is inadvisable, do as i say, not as i do.

sudo su
sudo mkdir /selinux
sudo touch /selinux/enforce
echo 0 > /selinux/enforce
sudo setenforce 0
sudo setenforce Permissive
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/selinux
#(change where it says SELINUX=enforcing to SELINUX=disabled)

#(you need to reboot for your changes to take effect)
sudo reboot now

#(all done!)
