# Disable Vsync in Minecraft Bedrock

Go to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftpe\
Open options.txt
Change gfx_vsync:1 to gfx_vsync:0 to disable V-sync.

AND

Force Vsync off through the GPU control panel, in the entry for the game.

Then you should be fine to play without feeling sick.
