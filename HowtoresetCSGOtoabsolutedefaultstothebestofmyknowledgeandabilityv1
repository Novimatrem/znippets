How to reset CS:GO to absolute defaults (to the best of my knowledge and ability) v1

Disable Steam Cloud synchronization in the properties for the game.

Clean out the launch options in Properties for the game, replace them with the following, and run the game once:

-default -autoconfig -dxlevel 90

When in game, open the console and type the following four commands.
exec config_default
exec default.cfg
exit

Uninstall the game from Steam, AND THEN delete the entire game's folder from steamapps.

Delete the contents of the folder ~/.steam/steam/userdata/<your steam id number>/730
In that folder, create an empty 0 byte file named remotecache.vdf, after that. (using the touch command or some right-click menus)

Close Steam, open Steam again.

Reinstall CS:GO.

Launch the game again.
When in game, open the console and type the following three commands.
exec config_default
exec default.cfg
exit

Go into your launch options and empty them out entirely.

Your CS:GO is now reset. Enjoy playing!
