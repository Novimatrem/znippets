I have my eyes set on getting an AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT, and a reasonable CPU cooler, for my birthday, in May, so that my performance in some
 games (notably older ones that rely more on single-core performance, and less on the GPU) can finally become closer to what I have been 
  wanting for a long time.
