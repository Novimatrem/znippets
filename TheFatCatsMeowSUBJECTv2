The Fat Cat's Meow - A safespace for Furries and Otherkin.

Please keep it lighthearted, fun, and not immensely lewd.

Try to keep heavier, stressful, and/or triggering topics out of here, or to DM's with those who have agreed to discuss that with you.

- Have fun!
- Be kind to all.
- English only, so moderation is possible.
- Respect everyone.
- Use common sense.
- No fatphobia.
