# Potential Cyberpunk 2077 Crash on Logos fix for AMD on Linux (Steam Launch option) 

# Open your launch options in the properties for the game
# Put this in there, if you DON'T have any launch options.

VKD3D_CONFIG=host_import_fallback %command% --launcher-skip



# If you DO have launch options, 

# prepend this to it (put it at the start)
VKD3D_CONFIG=host_import_fallback

# AND append this to it (put it at the end) 
--launcher-skip


# You shouldn't crash now. Yay
