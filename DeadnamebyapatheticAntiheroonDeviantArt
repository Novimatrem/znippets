# Deadname by apatheticAntihero on DeviantArt


A deadname is dead for a reason.
The taste of rotting things fills my mouth,
So bitter and nasty.
The dull sound plugs my ears,
And echoes around my head.
Sharp smelling, it hurts like a quick inhalation.
It feels like rejection, rough and somehow painfully soft.
Like being smothered in fluff,
That says “I'm trying, I'm sorry, I'm just so used to-”.
It screams “You can't be mad at me, I'm just a substitute teacher, it's just a
habit, you have to accept that I don't accept you.”
I want a name that tastes like cold, cloudy quartz against my tongue,
Like nothing and something.
I want a name that sounds like satisfaction.
I want it to smell like a slow, calm breath.
I want it to feel like perfect weather, warm and cool,
Like crisp water droplets bouncing off glass.
I want to be a fresh, new me,
Not the corpse that I buried years ago.
