Mirror's Edge custom sensitivity, sensitivity fix (+higher/lower than allowed)

A custom (+ lower/higher than allowed) mouse sensitivity can be set through bindings in a config file. 
Find the [Engine.PlayerInput] section in the config file,
My Documents\EA Games\Mirror's Edge\TdGame\Config\TdInput.ini and add a line like this:

Bindings=(Name="NumPadOne",Command="Setsensitivity 7",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)

This example binds numpad 1 to set a sensitivity of 7.

The file may be set as read-only by default, you can untick that in Properties, before editing it.

Just MAKE SURE that TdInput.ini is set to read-only AGAIN before you start the game,
else your changes would be overwritten by the game.
