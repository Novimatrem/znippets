# (set your keyboard to Dvorak in the GUI's you'd normally expect.)

# or use this command
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources "[('xkb', 'us+dvorak')]"

# (then set up this)
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

# (run this, and maybe put it in some other places like the .bashrc, startup applications)
setxkbmap dvorak

# either remove the letter labels from your keys or change/swap them to dvorak layout physically

# print out the dvorak layout on paper/card, put it near your desk/where you type

# now live your life dvorak, do your things using it

# play typeracer, the typing of the dead, terminal game typespeed, etc, to improve
# terminal app dvorak7min seems very useful
# learn.dvorak.nl is really good for learning



# (after maybe 6 months, if you feel you are good enough at dvorak you should start to touch type;
# if you can't stop yourself from looking at the key labels while learning touch-typing dvorak you
# may need to either buy a no-key labels keyboard like the Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate, or remove your
# key-labels yourself with DIY [sand-paper recommended])
