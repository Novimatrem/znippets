After spending my entire day debugging in Garry's Mod, I want to say this:

If you are suffering from lua panic not enough memory errors in Garry's Mod, ensure that you are NOT subscribed to the addon "Simple Garbage Collector" by 'techno atomic tangerine'

Not an addon for me. Either something's wrong with it, or the regular automatic garbage collection is saving my existing setup from breaking. For me this addon causes lots (100MB+) of initial extra lua memory load, and seems to allow things to leak memory (or has one itself) until the game crashes. So, not for my setup.

I wouldn't recommend it, and if you have it installed, uninstall it, or your game may suffer heavily.
