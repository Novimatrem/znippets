# If you are reading this, I am ALWAYS online on Discord when I'm not asleep.
# Discord has very bad online status indication, that would lead you to believe I'm offline, 
# but it isn't true.
# Within a moment I can see whatever you send me, as a notification, on both my desktop and phone,
# just because it's not green doesn't mean otherwise.
# So this script makes the online status indicator work in such a way that'll cause you less anxiety- 
# without changing my (always immediate) ability to access Discord at all times.
# I promise.
# I'm not abandoning you, Discord is just badly designed.

# Repeat given char 80 times using shell function
