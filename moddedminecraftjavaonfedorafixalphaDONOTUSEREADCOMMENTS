# modded minecraft on fedora fix alpha DO NOT USE, READ COMMENTS

# this is dumb as fuck, don't run this- don't do this. i was desperate
# you will lose the ability to update your system whilst oracle's java is installed, after running this script.
# to restore the ability to update the system, you need to uninstall oracle's java, with the command sudo dnf remove -y jdk1.8-2000:1.8.0_311-fcs.x86_64 (or thereabouts, use tab completion on jdk1.8-)
# t-then you could just, you know.. do this process again to get modded minecraft back :) :)


# this is not a script, this is a manual process, copy paste into your terminal, read comments, the whole jobby VVV

# start
sudo dnf autoremove -y && sudo dnf check -y && sudo dnf upgrade -y && sudo dnf distro-sync -y && sudo dnf autoremove -y && sudo dnf check -y

sudo dnf remove -y java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo dnf remove -y java-11-openjdk-headless
sudo dnf remove -y java-11-openjdk

#<download java 8 from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ {requires signup!!}>

sudo rpm -ivh ./jdk-8u311-linux-x64.rpm

sudo dnf autoremove -y && sudo dnf check -y && sudo dnf upgrade -y && sudo dnf distro-sync -y && sudo dnf autoremove -y && sudo dnf check -y

# restart the PC

sudo dnf autoremove -y && sudo dnf check -y && sudo dnf upgrade -y && sudo dnf distro-sync -y && sudo dnf autoremove -y && sudo dnf check -y

sudo alternatives --config java

java --version

java -version

# set minecraft's java executable to /usr/bin/java in more options under edit installation of the install you're using

# CONGRATULATIONS, RUN IT, IT SHOULD WORK NOW!! YOU'RE DONE, HAVE FUN!!

# bonus note: i strongly recommend using multimc, it will allow you to ensure you're using the-
        -right java, and will also allow you to easily assign the amount of RAM the game can use.
